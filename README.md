# daily-stream-goals (Work In Progress)
Daily Stream Goals for StreamLabs ChatBot.

# Purpose
Provide streamers a means of tracking and displaying daily goals for follows/subs/cheers/donations. Both 'current' and 'target' goals are written to .txt files for use to display on stream.

# Limitations
* Currently only available on Twitch.
* For the moment, client side only. Any events that occur while SLChatBot is off, will not be recorded. Thinking of a solution.

# Contributions
ALWAYS WELCOME!
