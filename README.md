# daily-stream-goals
Daily Stream Goals for StreamLabs ChatBot.

# Limitations
* Only available on Twitch platform.
* For the moment, client side only. Any events that occur while SLChatBot is off, will not be recorded. Thinking of a solution.

# Contributions
ALWAYS WELCOME!

# Changes

## v1.1.0
* Ability to set separation string between current current value and target goal.
* Output SubOutput.txt, FollowOutput.txt files `{current}{separator}{target}`
  *  Example: `10/500`

## v1.0.0
* Provide streamers a means of tracking and displaying daily goals for follows/subs/cheers/donations. Both 'current' and 'target' goals are written to .txt files for use to display on stream.
